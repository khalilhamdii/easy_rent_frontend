![Microverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Microverse-6F23FF?style=for-the-badge)

## Description

EasyRent is a car renting management web application. It's built using React & Redux in the Front-end and Ruby On Rails in the Back-end. As a user, you can create a new account and have the ability to browse through available cars and make a rent request for a particular car. When logged in as an administrator, you can create, edit and delete cars. You are also provided with a panel to view and manage all rent requests from users.
